# newspaper
Just another one of my stupid projects.

The config file is generated on first run and can be located in `~/.config/newspaper/config.toml`. It comes preloaded with the
NASA image of the day as its only feed, though you could of course add whatever you wanted. I'll work on this more later, I'm
just really busy with school right now.
